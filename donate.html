            <h1>VSLA at Work </h1>
            <p>“My name is Ladi Pwajok, a caregiver with three children – Blessing Pwajok 17, Francis Pwajok 12 and, Rebecca Pwajok 8 of Latya community of Jos-South LGA, Plateau State. In 2015, I discontinued my casual jobs at the mining sites as a result of rheumatism and instead, began petty trade at home. I immediately became very weary because I was not making any profit since items from the petty shop where being consumed in the home. Two years later, January of 2017, I and the children decided that the way forward was for me to rent a shop away from the house. I located a shop in the community center where business activities are busy but unfortunately, the shop had been taken. In order not to spend the savings of Sixty thousand naira (N60,000) at hand I again decide to immediately invest it into Piggery. Two weeks after, 30th of May 2017, I was invited pay for the shop which was again available but unfortunately, I had no available funds yet I had hope that was made available by my community Voluntary Savings and Loans Association (VSLA). Thanks to my VSLA, I had immediate access to credit of One hundred thousand naira only (N100,000) and with that amount I was able to pay for the shop and buy items for the shop too. <br>
                    <br>
                Although I participate in other types of savings, I am really enjoying the VSLA and to me, VSLA is the best since it is flexible, simple and efficient to all committed members. I have accessed loan in the past to pay school fees, purchase fertilizer, and for business purposes, loans which I have paid back with low interest. Thank you HTYF for bringing VSLA to my community”. <br>
                    <br>
                Ladi is one of the 1,615 caregivers HTYF had the privileged of serving during the 5-year Systems Transformed for Empowered Action and Enabling Responses for Vulnerable Children and Families (STEER), 2014-2017 with funding from USAID through Save The Children International across 19 communities of Jos South LGA of Plateau State. The goal of project was to improve the well-being of orphans and vulnerable children. <br>
                    <br>
                With sustained donations from companies, institutions and individuals like you, we will uplift one family at a time in Nigeria. <br>
